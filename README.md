# Profit-Maximization-of-Flanges

Collected data from Indian Company G.N Altech regarding 7 types of flanges it produces. The end goal was to determine the optimal number of flanges to be produced to maximize profitability and reduce bottlenecks.

Formed mathematical model with limited resources such as labour restrictions, time restrictions and number of flanges required. Once we had our objective function and constraints prepared, we implemented the model on AMPL and solved using CPLEX and GUROBI.

Performed thorough Sensitivity Analysis using Excel and proposed changes by utilizing process surplus time in certain areas and increasing time available in bottlenecks, resulting in higher profits.

Finally communicated or presented our findings to the class.
